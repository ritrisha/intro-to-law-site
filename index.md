    <h2>Meaning of Law</h2>
    <p>Have you ever felt the necessity of ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô in your day to day life? Have you seen any one being booked by the Traffic Police for Violating traffic rules? Do you feel the necessity of a birth certificate when a child is born? After death, do you know the importance of a death certificate? In fact, Law affects all aspects of our life. It rules us from cradle to grave. It protects us right from the mother‚Äôs womb to our education, service, marriage and other important events of life. Law plays an important role in our daily life, right from buying a newspaper or a bottle of milk or any other big or small item necessary for our life. Law is so important for our life that it becomes necessary to understand various aspects of law viz. What are the sources of Law, what are the kinds of Law and finally its application for the best use of our society.</p>

          <h2>1.1 Meaning and Definition of Law?</h2>
          <p>‚ÄòLaw‚Äô signifies a rule applied indiscriminately to all actions. It is a notional pattern of conduct to which actions do or ought to conform. ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô is a large body of rules
            and regulations, based mainly on general principles of justice, fair play and convenience and which have been worked out by governmental bodies to regulate human activities.</p>
          <p>In broader sense, ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô denotes the whole process by which organized society, through government bodies and personnel (Law-makers, Courts, Tribunals, Law Enforcement Agencies
            and Executive, Penal and corrective Institutions etc.) attempt to apply rules and regulations to establish and maintain peaceful and orderly relations amongst the people in 
            the society.</p>
          <p>The idea of ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô as guide to human conduct is as old as the existence of the civilized society. The relevance of law to human behavior has become so intimate today that every
            person has his or her own conception about its nature which is influenced, of course, by his/her own perspective. Not surprisingly the search for an agreed definition of ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô
            has been an endless journey.</p>
          <p>There have been conflicting and divergent views of jurists regarding the nature, concept, basis and functions of Law. ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô has been regarded as a divinely ordained rule or 
            a tradition of the old customs or recorded wisdom of the wise men or philosophically discovered system of principles which expresses the nature of things or as a body of 
            ascertainments and declaration of an eternal and immutable moral code, or as a body of agreements of men/women in politically organized society, or as a reflection of divine 
            reason or as a body of commands of the sovereign, or as a body of rules discovered by human experience, or a body of rules developed through juristic writings and judicial 
            decisions or as a body of rules imposed on men/women in society by the dominant class, or as a body of rules in terms of economic and social goals of the individuals.</p>
          <p>Therefore, Law can be defined firstly - by its basis in nature, reason, religion or ethics, secondly - by its sources like customs, precedent and legislation, thirdly ‚Äì 
            by its effect on the life of the society, fourthly ‚Äì by the method of its formal expression or authoritative application, fifthly ‚Äì by the ends that it seeks to achieve.</p>
          <p>Although, there is no general definition of Law which includes all the aspects of Law yet for a general understanding, some of the important definitions are as follows:</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th><strong>Jurist</strong></th>
              <th><strong>Definition / View on Law</strong></th>

              <td>According to Paton, ‚ÄúLaw consists of a body of rules which are seen to operate as binding rules in the community by means of which sufficient compliance with the rules
                may be secured to enable the set of rules to be seen as binding.‚Äù</td>

          <h2>1.2 Classifications of Law</h2>
          <p>
          For a proper and logical understanding of Law, its classification becomes necessary. It helps in understanding the principles and logical structure of the legal order. It makes clear the inter-relation of rules and their effect on each other and it also helps in arranging the rules in a concise and systematic way. <br/>
The broad classification of law may be as follows: <p>
          <h3>1. International Law</h3>
<p>International Law is a branch of law which consists of rules which regulate relations between States or Nations inter se. In other words, International Law is a body of customary and conventional rules which are considered to be legally binding by civilized Nations in their intercourse with each other. International Law is mainly based on Treaties between civilized Nations.</p>

<h4>(a) Public International Law</h4>
<p>It is that body of rules which governs the conduct and relations of State with other States. For example, the extradition treaty between two states to bring back the fugitives.</p>

<h4>(b) Private International Law</h4>
<p>It means those rules and principles according to which the cases having foreign elements are decided. For example, if a contract is entered into in India between an Indian and a Pakistan citizen, which is to be performed in Ceylon, then the rules and regulations on which the rights and liabilities of the parties would be determined is known as ‚ÄòPrivate International Law‚Äô.</p>

<h3>2. Municipal Law or National Law</h3>
<p>Municipal Law is that branch of Law, which is applied within a State. It can be divided into two classes:</p>

<h4>(a) Public Law</h4>
<p>It regulates the organization and functioning of the State and determines the relations of the State with its subjects. It may be divided into three classes:</p>

<h5>i. Constitutional Law</h5>
<p>Constitutional Law is the basic or fundamental law of the State. It is a law which determines the nature of State and the structure of the Government. It is superior to the ordinary law of the land because ordinary law derives its authority and force from the Constitutional Law.</p>

<h5>ii. Administrative Law</h5>
<p>This law deals with the structure, powers and functions of the organs of administration; the limits of their power; the methods and procedure followed by them in exercise of their power; the methods by which their powers are controlled, including remedies available to a person against them when his/her rights are infringed by their operation.</p>

<h5>iii. Criminal Law</h5>
<p>It defines offences and prescribes punishment for them. Its aim is the prevention of and punishment for offences because in civilized societies, ‚Äòcrime‚Äô is considered to be a wrong not against the individual but against the society.</p>

<h4>(b) Private Law</h4>
<p>This branch of law regulates and governs the relations of citizens with each other. It includes Personal Law e.g. Hindu Law and Muslim Law.</p>

<h3>Other Varieties of Law</h3>

<h4>Natural or Moral Law</h4>
<p>Natural Law is based upon the principle of right and wrong. It embodies the principles of Natural Justice.</p>

<h4>Conventional Law</h4>
<p>Conventional Law means any rule or system of rules agreed upon by persons for regulation of their conduct towards each other. For example, Indian Contract Act, 1872 deals with the rules on making agreements.</p>

<h4>Customary Law</h4>
<p>Any rule of action which is actually observed by men/women when a Custom is firmly established, is enforced by the State as law because of its general approval by the people.</p>

<h4>Civil Law</h4>
<p>The Law enforced by the State is called Civil Law. The force of State is the sanction behind this Law. Civil Law is essentially territorial in nature as it applies within the territory of the State concerned.</p>

<h4>Substantive Law</h4>
<p>Substantive Law deals with rights and obligations of the individuals against the State and prescribes the offences and punishments for the commission of such offences. For example, Indian Penal Code, 1860 contains 511 Sections on various offences and corresponding punishments for those offences.</p>

<h4>Procedural Law</h4>
<p>It deals with the practice and procedure having its objective to facilitate the administration of justice. It is a process necessary to be undertaken for enforcement of the legal rights and liabilities of the litigating parties by a Court of Law. For example, the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 enshrines the procedures to be followed to inflict punishment on the wrongdoer.</p>

          <h2>1.3 Sources of Law</h2>
          <h3>Sources of Law</h3>
<p>For a complete understanding of the concept of Law it is necessary to understand the sources of law. Source, literally means a point, from which anything emerges, rises or emanates. The expression ‚Äòsource of law‚Äô, therefore, means the source from where rules of human conduct came into existence and derive legal force of binding character. Broadly, sources of law can be divided as follows:</p>

<h4>1. Custom</h4>
<p>‚ÄòCustom‚Äô is the oldest and most important source of Law. ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô is an embodiment of those principles which have commended themselves to the natural conscience as principles of justice and public utility. ‚ÄòCustoms‚Äô originate in frequent repetition of the same act, and therefore, denotes rules of habitual conduct within a community. Uniformity of conduct in like circumstances is, thus, the hallmark of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô.</p>

<h5>Essentials of a Custom</h5>
<p>To be valid source of Law, a customary practice must fulfil some requirements, of which following are the most important:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Antiquity:</strong> A ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô to be recognized as a law must be proved to be in existence from time immemorial or from long time period.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuance:</strong> The second essential of a ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô is that it must have been in practice continuously.</li>
  <li><strong>Reasonableness:</strong> A ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô should not be unreasonable, i.e., it must be reasonable in its application to the circumstances of the individual cases. It must not be otherwise imprudent, harsh or inconvenient.</li>
  <li><strong>Obligatory Character:</strong> The ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô must have obligatory force. It must have been supported by the general public opinion and enjoyed as a matter of right.</li>
  <li><strong>Certainty:</strong> A ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô must be certain. A ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô which is vague or indefinite cannot be recognized.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Customary rules should show a consistency in observance of a practice. If a practice has not been consistently followed it cannot attain the status of a ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô.</li>
  <li><strong>Conformity with Statutory Law and Public Policy:</strong> A ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô should be in conformity with a Statute Law and public policy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Judicial Precedent</h4>
<p>‚ÄòPrecedent‚Äô signifies a set pattern upon which future conduct may be based. It may be an earlier event, decision or action followed in parallel circumstances later. A ‚ÄòJudicial Precedent‚Äô is an independent source of Law. ‚ÄòStare Decisis‚Äô is a Latin word which denotes ‚Äòto stand by past decision or precedents and not to disturb the settled points‚Äô. Precedent or stare decisis denote employment of past judicial decisions as a guide for making of future ones for lower courts in hierarchy.</p>

<p>A ‚ÄòJudicial Precedent‚Äô or ‚Äòstare decisis‚Äô has a binding force for the subsequent cases. It is not the whole judgment that is to be binding. In other words, every statement made by the judge in an earlier decision is not binding in future case. Only those statements in an earlier decision which may be said to constitute the reason for the decision or ‚Äò<em>ratio decidendi</em>‚Äô of that case are binding as matter of general principle, in subsequent cases. ‚Äò<em>Ratio decidendi</em>‚Äô is the general principle which is deduced in a case. It is the rule of law upon which the decision is founded and it is authoritative in nature.</p>

<p>Apart from ‚Äò<em>ratio decidendi</em>‚Äô, a judgment may contain observations not precisely relevant to the issue before the Court. These may be the observations upon the broader aspects of law or answer to the hypothetical questions raised by judges or counsels in the course of hearing. Such observations are ‚Äò<em>obiter dicta</em>‚Äô and without any binding authority, in so far as these are not essential to the decision reached.</p>

<h4>3. Legislation</h4>
<p>‚ÄòLegislation‚Äô is a deliberate process of legal evolution which consists in the formulation of norms of human conduct in a set form through a prescribed procedure by agencies designated by the Constitution. ‚ÄòLegislation‚Äô means to make rules for human conduct.</p>

<p>The term ‚ÄòLegislation‚Äô is derived from the word ‚Äò<em>legis</em>‚Äô meaning ‚Äòlaw‚Äô and ‚Äò<em>latum</em>‚Äô which means to make or set. Thus, the word ‚Äòlegislation‚Äô means making of law. It is a source of Law which consists in declaration of legal rules by competent authority. ‚ÄòLegislation‚Äô includes every expression of the will of the legislature, whether making law or not.</p>
